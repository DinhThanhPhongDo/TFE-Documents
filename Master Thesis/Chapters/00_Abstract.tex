\section*{Abstract}
In the construction industry, there is growing interest in adopting new building technologies, including laser scanning technologies such as Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR).\\

Additionally, advancements in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms enable robots, such as Boston Dynamics's SPOT, to autonomously navigate construction sites and generate point clouds. These point clouds serve as valuable data for monitoring purposes.\\

The aim of this thesis is to develop a method for monitoring significant differences between two point clouds acquired at different stages of the construction process. Furthermore, the proposed method can be extended to compare point clouds with Building Information Modeling (BIM) data, facilitating comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the construction progress.\\

By addressing the challenges of comparing and analyzing point clouds in the context of construction site monitoring, this research contributes to the advancement of construction industry practices and the adoption of innovative technologies.
